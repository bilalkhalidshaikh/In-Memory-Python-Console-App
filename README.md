# Evolution of Todo — Phase I

## In-Memory Python Console App (Spec‑Driven Implementation)

This repository contains **Phase I** of the *Hackathon II – Evolution of Todo* project. In this phase, the application is implemented as an **in-memory Python console-based Todo application**, developed strictly using **Spec‑Driven Development** with **Claude Code** and **Spec‑Kit Plus**.

The goal of Phase I is to build the foundational Todo system without persistent storage, while mastering the workflow of writing specifications first and generating implementation via AI.

---

## Phase Objective

Build a command-line Todo application that:

* Stores tasks in memory
* Supports core CRUD operations
* Demonstrates spec-driven development
* Uses Claude Code for implementation generation
* Follows clean Python project structure

No manual coding is allowed. Implementation is generated by refining specifications until Claude Code produces the correct output.

---

## Implemented Features (Basic Level)

The console application implements all required **Basic Level** Todo features:

### Core Task Operations

* Add new tasks
* View all tasks
* Update task details
* Delete tasks by ID
* Mark tasks as complete or incomplete

### Task Attributes

Each task contains:

* Title
* Description
* Completion status
* Unique ID

---

## Spec‑Driven Development Workflow

Development strictly follows the Agentic Dev Stack workflow:

1. Write feature specification
2. Generate implementation plan
3. Break plan into tasks
4. Claude Code generates implementation
5. Refine specs until correct output is achieved

The repository preserves the specification history to demonstrate this process.

## Technology Stack

| Component            | Technology    |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Language             | Python 3.13+  |
| Environment          | UV Python     |
| AI Coding            | Claude Code   |
| Specification Engine | Spec‑Kit Plus |

## Project Structure

```

├── constitution/          # Project constitution files
├── specs/                 # Specification files for features
├── history/               # Specification iteration history
├── src/                   # Python source code

│   └── cli.py             # Console interaction layer
├── CLAUDE.md              # Claude Code instructions
└── README.md
```

Structure may vary slightly depending on generation iterations but follows clean modular separation.

---

## Application Capabilities

The console app demonstrates:

* Adding tasks with title and description
* Viewing all tasks with completion indicators
* Updating task details
* Deleting tasks using IDs
* Marking tasks as complete/incomplete

All data exists only in memory and resets when the program exits.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

* Python 3.13 or higher
* UV package manager installed

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd evolution-of-todo-phase1
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Run the application:

```bash
uv run python src/main.py
```

---

## Windows Users — WSL2 Setup (Required)

Windows users must use **WSL2** for development.

Install WSL2:

```bash
wsl --install
wsl --set-default-version 2
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04
```

Then clone and run the project inside the Ubuntu environment.

---

## Deliverables Included

This repository contains all required Phase I deliverables:

* Spec-driven project implementation
* Constitution files
* Specification history
* Python console Todo application
* Claude Code instruction file
* Setup and usage documentation

---

## Demonstration Checklist

The console application supports:

* Creating tasks
* Viewing task list
* Updating tasks
* Deleting tasks
* Marking tasks complete/incomplete

All operations are available via console interaction.

---

## Learning Outcome of Phase I

After completing Phase I, developers understand:

* Spec‑Driven Development workflow
* Iterative AI-assisted implementation
* Clean Python project structuring
* Task CRUD logic fundamentals

This phase serves as the foundation for evolving the application into:

* Phase II: Full-stack web application
* Phase III: AI chatbot
* Phase IV: Kubernetes deployment
* Phase V: Cloud-native event-driven architecture

---

## Next Phase Preview

Phase II transforms this console app into a **multi-user web application** using Next.js, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL with persistent storage.
